# Bridge It On! 🌉

A physics-based bridge building game developed in Godot, where players design and test bridges to safely transport vehicles across challenging gaps.

## 🎮 Game Overview

Bridge It On is an engineering puzzle game that challenges players to construct stable bridges within budget constraints. Using realistic stress and strain physics, players must balance structural integrity with cost efficiency to successfully guide vehicles from one side to the other.

### Key Features
- **Realistic Physics**: Simplified Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for authentic structural behavior
- **Visual Stress Feedback**: Beams change color (green → yellow → red) based on stress levels
- **Multiple Vehicles**: Cars, trucks, and buses with varying weights and physics
- **Budget Management**: Strategic resource allocation for optimal bridge designs
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Multiple levels with increasing complexity
